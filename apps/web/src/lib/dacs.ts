// "Find your DAC": which answers a DAC gives to the picker's two questions (how it
// takes DSD, how it converts PCM), with the evidence for each row. The models are in
// dac-models.ts. Checked 2026-10-05.
//
// Rules for these files (dacs.test.ts checks what it can):
// - A row goes in only when its chip or design and its DSD handling are confirmed
//   from a source we opened: the maker first, else a review or measurement. A row we
//   can't confirm is left out, never guessed.
// - Signalyst's advice (Jussi Laako's posts) is cited post by post, paraphrased, with
//   what it's about. Modulator advice keeps the principle (order, rate, 512+fs), never
//   an older-series modulator's name: newer modulators may suit better (isDated).
// - `ourReading` marks an answer that is our judgement, not Signalyst's or the maker's.
// - Corrections arrive as GitHub issues ("DAC table: …") with a link to the spec sheet.
