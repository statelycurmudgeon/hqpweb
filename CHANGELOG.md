# Changelog

Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Before 1.0, any release
may change behaviour; upgrade notes say what you need to do.

## Unreleased

- **Filter and modulator descriptions (HQPlayer 6):** each filter shows HQPlayer's
  own rating (stars); tap ⓘ for what it favours (transients, timbre, space) and the
  ratios it works with. Chips narrow the list (5/5, a focus, "works here"), and
  Settings can group the list by rating. Modulators show their generation (Gen1–8).
- **Ratio warnings use HQPlayer 6's own rule** when it gives one. On v5 we follow
  the v5 manual, except where measured otherwise: on Desktop 5.17.2 sinc-M needs a
  power-of-two ratio (it refuses 3×, and 2× down plays), not "whole-number". FFT
  allows power-of-two either way, and the ext2 variants are covered.
- **v5 instances get the same guide:** ratings and focus borrowed from HQPlayer 6 by
  name; v5-only filters and modulators described from the v5 manual.
- **Compatible filters first.** When the output rate is fixed, filters that can't do
  the current conversion ratio are hidden by a "compatible" chip (on by default; "Show
  all" lists them struck through). Picking one offers the output rates that fit, marks
  the closest, offers Auto, or applies anyway; the filter and rate change together.
- **"The next track won't start."** When HQPlayer is stopped and the track queued in
  its playlist can't play with the current filter and fixed rate, the Now card says
  why, with a fix: rates that fit, Auto, or another filter. (HQPlayer itself just
  ignores Play.) With a fixed rate, a note under the filters also warns about source
  rates the next album might use.
- **Volume jumps are flagged.** If HQPlayer's volume rises 10 dB or more without
  hqpweb (a restart brings it back at its saved level; v6 at −3 dB, measured), the Now
  card says so, with "Back to −44 dB" and Dismiss.
- **"HQPlayer didn't start."** HQPlayer replies OK to Play even when nothing can start.
  After a Play from hqpweb, if nothing starts within a few seconds, the app says so,
  and why when a rule explains it; otherwise it points at the output (an NAA in use
  elsewhere, a DAC that's off).
- **Apod and clip counters.** HQPlayer's apodization counter appears once it's above
  0 (amber; red past 10, where HQPlayer's manual suggests an apodizing filter, with a
  link that opens the filter list narrowed to apodizing filters). The clip counter
  appears once above 0, with a hint to lower the volume. Filters carry an "apodizing"
  chip, from HQPlayer 6's own filter table (yes, no or partly).
- **"Processing" shows HQPlayer's processing speed** (e.g. 32×) on 5.17.2 and 6.x.
- **Seek** within files HQPlayer plays itself.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 — first public release

**Install:** see the README. **Update:** `git pull && docker compose up -d --build`.

### What's in it

- **Instances:** discovery on the local network segment (with host networking), or
  add by address; rename; the name defaults to the one HQPlayer reports.
- **Now card:** output rate, mode, source format, playback state, track position,
  and **Processing** (whether HQPlayer keeps up with real time: Real-time ✓,
  Straining or Falling behind, from a 30 s fit of its position), plus volume.
- **Quick changes:** 1x and Nx filters, dither or modulator, volume, with hints
  from HQPlayer's documented rules on combinations that won't play.
- **Advanced:** mode, output rate, convolution on/off, matrix profile, polarity,
  20 kHz filter, adaptive volume.
- **Checked and reversible:** every change is read back; a change that stops
  playback or leaves HQPlayer unable to keep up is rolled back, remembered, and
  warned about next time. Undo for the last change. Volume is never raised more than
  6 dB at once, and undo and rollback never raise it.
- **Presets:** named sets of settings shared across instances, previewed per
  instance (active, quick or major change), saved with or without volume.
- **Transport:** previous, play/pause and next. With Roon as the source and no Roon
  link, only Stop (play and next sent to HQPlayer don't reach Roon).
- **Roon (optional, off by default):** now playing with cover art, a seek slider and
  working transport for the Roon zone that feeds each HQPlayer.
- **Install:** one Docker container, settings in a Docker volume, no login (see
  Security in the README).

### Known limits

- Tested on HQPlayer Desktop 5 (macOS and Linux). Embedded, HQPlayer 6 and Windows
  are untested.
- HQPlayer's saved configurations and its output device can't be switched: the
  control protocol doesn't allow it (README: "Why can't I switch profiles or
  endpoints?").
- Discovery doesn't cross VLANs or routed subnets; add instances by address.

### For the two pre-release installs

If you ran a build from before this release: the container is now `hqpweb` (run
`docker compose down` before pulling); settings moved from `./config` to a Docker
volume (`docker compose cp config/instances.json controller:/config/` once, then
`docker compose restart`); the default port is 4380 (was 8787); and the parked
library browser now lives on the `library` branch.
